## Touch and pointer target sizes
Touch targets are the parts of the screen that respond to user input, extending beyond the visual bounds of an element. For example, an icon may appear to be 24 x 24dp, but the padding surrounding it comprises the full 48 x 48dp touch target.

For most platforms, consider making touch targets at least 48 x 48dp. A touch target this size results in a physical size of about 9mm, regardless of screen size. The recommended target size for touchscreen elements is 7-10mm. It may be appropriate to use larger touch targets to accommodate a larger spectrum of users.

Note: iOS recommends 44 x 44dp targets. 

## Target spacing
In most cases, targets separated by 8dp of space or more promote balanced information density and usability.
