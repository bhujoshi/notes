## Basic responsive design principles

#### Fluid layouts

- To allow veiwport to adopt the current veiwport width (even height)
- Use % (or vh, vw) units instead of px.
- Use max-width instead of width

#### Responsive units

- Use rem unit instead of px for most length.

#### Flexible images

- By default the images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport so we need to fix that.
- Allways use percentage for image dimensions. together with the max-width.

#### Media querys

- To change the css layout depending on the veiwport width.
